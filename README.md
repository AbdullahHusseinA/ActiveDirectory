**Server 2019 Setup and Configuration Steps**

* ***Administrator Account Setup***
    - Set the password for the built-in administrator account.
    - Logged in as the built-in administrator.

* ***Network Configuration:***
    - Selected Network settings.
    - Clicked on Change Adapter options.
    - Renamed the network connections:
        - Public-facing adapter: INTERNET_1
        - Internal network adapter: INTERNAL_2

* ***Static IP Configuration for X_Internal_X Adapter:***
    - Assigned the following static IP configuration:
        - IP Address: 172.16.20.1
        - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
        - Default Gateway: the Domain Controller serves as the gateway
        - DNS: 127.0.0.1 (loopback)

* ***PC Renaming:***
    - Navigated to Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings.
    - Renamed the PC to "Domain Controller," matching the name set in VirtualBox.

* ***Restart:***
    - Restarted the VM for changes to take effect.

**Setting Up Active Directory**

* Add Active Directory Domain Services through Server Manager.
* Promote the VM to a domain controller.
* Create a new forest with the domain "mydomain.com."

**User and Group Management**

* Logged back into the VM.
* Accessed Active Directory Users and Computers.
* Created a new Organizational Unit named _ADMINS.
* Established a new user account for myself.
* Added myself to the Domain Admins group.
* Logged in using the new domain admin account.

**Setting Up Routing and Remote Access (RAS)**
* Install Remote Access role in Server Manager.
* Configure and enable Routing and Remote Access.
* Specify NAT and select the network adapter for internet access that I previously named INTERNET_1.

**DHCP Setup:**

* ***In Server Manager:***
    - Added DHCP role.
    - Installed DHCP.
* ***Accessed DHCP from Tools in Server Manager.***
* ***Created a new scope:***
    - Range: 172.16.0.100â€“200.
    - CIDR prefix length: 24 (subnet mask: 255.255.255.0).
    - Lease duration: 8 days. (this if for a home lab)
* ***Configured DHCP options:***
    - Default Gateway: 172.16.0.1.
    - Parent domain: mydomain.com.
    - Activated the scope.
* ***Finalized setup:***
    - Authorized DHCP server.
    - Refreshed for confirmation (green circle with checkbox).

**Automating User Creation with PowerShell**

I obtained Josh's PS script for adding extra users directly from the VM. The script is available on his GitHub [here](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS).

* Downloaded and extracted a PS script in the VM from a .zip file to the desktop.
* Added my name, "Abdullah Hussein" to the top of a .txt file with randomly generated names.
* Launched PowerShell ISE as administrator and opened the PS script.
* Set execution policy to Unrestricted and allowed the script to run.
* Changed the directory in PowerShell to the script's folder.
* Successfully ran the script.

* I proceeded to Active Directory to confirm the creation of the users.

Now that the Server VM is all set up, the next step is to create a new VM for a Workstation. I'll be installing Windows 10 on it and configuring it for use within our freshly established Active Directory Domain network.

**Windows 10 Workstation Integration**

* Create a new VM in VirtualBox named "Client1."
* Set memory size to 2048 MB and configure network settings.
* Selected VM settings, then Network, Adapter 1 tab
    - Switched to Internal Network

* Installed Windows 10 and set up a local account.
* Accessed Control Panel from the Start menu.
* Navigated to System > Advanced System Settings > Name tab.
* Selected 'Change' to rename the PC and join it to the domain.
* Renamed the VM to CLIENT1 and joined mydomain.com.
* Authenticated with domain administrator credentials.
* Prompted to reboot the VM after finalizing the setup.
* Logged back in using the newly created AD account from the PowerShell script.

**DNS and Internet Connectivity Verification**
* Open Command Prompt on the Windows 10 VM.
* Execute the command `ipconfig` to see if ip address work.
* Execute the command `ping`to ping a website (www.google.com) to ensure DNS resolution.
* Confirm that the entire infrastructure is operational, indicating successful communication from the VM to the default gateway (Domain Controller) and proper NATting to the internet.
